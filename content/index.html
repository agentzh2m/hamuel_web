      Currently I am studying Computer Science at Mahidol University International College (578) I will probably graduate by 2018 my hobby is to play games,
      binge watch a lot of series and movies and lastly write code if I have time.
      My favourite class is Introduction to Programming even though it requires a lot of work in the end it really pays of because it allow me to write a wide variety of program and do things that I dream of doing when I was in middle school and highschool it enable me to fullfil my dream.
      This subject means so much to me because it is a subject that begins my journey as a cs student.

      		Toyota Tsushyo Electronics (TTET) change its name to NEXTY (toyota tsushyo nexty electronics) in the content development section I attempt to develop a new kind of distributed GIS database that is cost efficient to speed up storing gps data and fetching gps data more information is confidential because it is under NDA you can ask nexty for more information

      <p>General idea of this project the customer want to store information they got from questionaire to a central database the problem is that there are many provinces and no central database to upload to therefore this will display a computed summary of their finding and the client can easily upload their data to the central database</p>
      <p>In this job I wrote a python flask restful backend to store the uploaded data from many provinces the data is collected. After I computed the data I return a nice JSON format to the frontend written in react. I am responsible for creating an authentication gateway, security, setting roles and permission of each user. The admin can create user that can upload to their own province only. I used technique like file base caching so that the machine does not need to recompute everytime otherwise the server will not be able to handle the load.</p></div>

      <p>This competition have many phases at first it start at province phase after we compete in the regional phase and this is the last phase the national level where we compete with the best from every region. We competed in the National Software Contest in the category of software for helping disability people. We won 4th-5th place in the competition if I am more capable at that time I can also create a web app to send statistics to the doctor but I am just 2nd Year and my programming capability is quite limited. At least we are awarded with 10,000 baht of cash</p>

      	General idea for our project our fullname is Arm Rehabilitation Device for Stroke Patients. The patient will grab on to the controller and move their hand into the correct color to hit the mole. We hope the motion the user generated will help them have more fun in rehabilitating their arm so that they can use their arm again the picture below show how it work.

      <img width="250" height="150" class="img-responsive materialboxed" src="asset/ff1.jpg">
      <p>
      	My responsibility is to create a game to complement the device. The advisor professor recommend me to make a HIT a Mole game how it work the patient move their device to the color to move the hammer to the corresponding color on the game after that the patient squeeze the hammer to actually hit the mole after that they move the hammer back to the middle so that the next mole pop up and they can hit the next one.

      		ICPC-ACM is a college level competitive programming competition where many colleges compete in easy to very very hard programming problem within limited time. The programming question could be base on all type of algorithm and many ways of implementation.

      		<p>
      			Before we got to compete in the national round we compete in the regional round at first we don't get qualified in the regional round therefore there is a redemption round to compete in the national round we somehow have enough score to get into the national round.
      		</p>
      		<p>
      			Unfortunately we did not won any prize and got place at about 50-60 ranking in the national competition at least it was a good experience we should have done more practice we are quite happy that we got this far into the competition.
